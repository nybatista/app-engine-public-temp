# SpyneJS AppBuilder Project
**Repository:** spynejs-starter-app

This project is a fully wired SpyneJS application generated by the **SpyneJS App Builder**.

It uses the **VBL (View–Behavior–Logic)** architecture to keep rendering, interaction, and application logic structurally separate—so your app remains understandable, scalable, and safe to evolve as complexity grows.

You can treat this as a production-ready foundation: modify it freely, extend it incrementally, or use it as a reference model for how SpyneJS applications are structured.

## What This App Gives You

This is not a demo scaffold. It is a working application engine with:

- A clear, enforced separation between **View**, **Behavior**, and **Logic**
- A predictable project structure that scales without collapsing into coupling
- Tooling designed to support long-lived applications and AI-assisted evolution

SpyneJS favors architectural clarity over convenience abstractions. The goal is code that remains legible under pressure—by humans and machines.

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Webpack Dev / Prod Environments
- **`npm start`** → Hot reload development server
- **`npm run build`** → Optimized production build

### 🧩 SpyneJS VBL Architecture
- **View** → `ViewStream` components responsible only for rendering and DOM lifecycle
- **Behavior** → Channels that capture events, data flow, and synchronization
- **Logic** → Traits that hold application rules and reusable decision logic

This separation is enforced by design, not convention. Each layer has limited responsibilities and capabilities, preventing logic drift and accidental coupling as the application grows.

### 🎨 SCSS Integration
- Full SCSS/SASS support out of the box
- Includes the **Spyne Grid System** for mobile-first, utility-driven layouts

### 🧪 Unit Testing
- Preconfigured with **Web Test Runner**
- Uses **Mocha** and **Chai** for predictable, browser-based testing

### 📏 Linting / Formatting
- ESLint rules with a minimal, readable baseline
- Encourages consistency without over-configuration

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone your generated app or run via **`spyne-cli`**:

```bash
git clone <your-generated-repo>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```

### 🔍 Previewing the Production Build

When working with the production build, some IDE preview tools may not correctly handle SPA routing and asset paths, which can cause links or routes to appear broken.

To preview the production build locally in a way that mirrors real hosting behavior:

```bash
npm run build
npx serve dist

> Note: `npx serve` is used only for local preview. 
Any static host with equivalent behavior will work in production.
```

## 🌐 Hosting & Deployment

SpyneJS applications are **single-page applications (SPAs)** and can be hosted on any modern static or server-backed platform.

There is no platform lock-in. The only requirement is correct routing behavior.

### Core Hosting Rules

1. **All application routes must resolve to `index.html`**
    - Any request to a path that is not a real file should return `index.html`
    - This allows the SpyneJS runtime to handle routing internally

2. **Static assets must be served directly**
    - Requests to `/assets/*` should return the corresponding file
    - These requests should NOT be redirected to `index.html`

In short:
- **App routes → `index.html`**
- **Asset routes → actual files**

---

### Universal Hosting Prompt

You can use the following prompt when configuring or asking for help deploying this app on any platform:

> This is a single-page application.
>
> All requests to application paths should return `index.html`.
>
> Requests for static resources under `/assets/*` should return the corresponding asset directly and must not be rewritten.
>
> The server should not perform any client-side routing logic beyond this rewrite behavior.

This configuration works for platforms such as:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- CloudFront
- S3
- Nginx
- Apache
- Any CDN or static host with rewrite support

### Embedding in Other Applications

SpyneJS supports embedding inside other applications (CMSs, portals, shell apps).

When embedding:
- Use the **`query` route type** to drive application state via URL parameters
- Avoid relying on path-based routing when SpyneJS is not the top-level app

This allows SpyneJS to coexist cleanly inside existing systems without interfering with host routing.
